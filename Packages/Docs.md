Yes, that's an **excellent and comprehensive plan** for your class presentation!

You are absolutely right. Showing both approaches will give your class a very well-rounded understanding of how to build for visionOS:

1.  **Working with Code (SwiftUI, RealityKit):**
    * This is what we've been primarily focusing on with the `GeneralImmersiveView` and the `ARHandAttachedView` (before we removed it).
    * **Pros:** Offers maximum flexibility, dynamic behavior based on app state (like loading the *selected* shoe), fine-grained control over entities, animations, and interactions. It's essential for experiences that are tightly integrated with your app's logic and data.
    * **Your Example:** The `GeneralImmersiveView` loading different shoe models, allowing gestures, and placing copies are perfect demonstrations of this code-centric approach.

2.  **Working with Reality Composer Pro:**
    * This is Apple's dedicated tool for visually authoring, editing, and composing RealityKit scenes.
    * **Pros:** Great for artists and designers, rapid prototyping of scenes, setting up complex arrangements of objects, materials, lighting, sounds, and even simple behaviors and animations with less code. It's ideal for creating rich, pre-defined environments or interactive dioramas.
    * **Your Example:** The default "Immersive" scene in your `RealityKitContent` package (the one with the two spheres and grid, likely `Immersive/Scene.usdz`) was almost certainly created or can be edited with Reality Composer Pro. The `DefaultSceneImmersiveView` we set up loads this kind of pre-built scene.

**How They Relate (and what your class will learn):**

* You can load entire scenes built in Reality Composer Pro into your app (as `DefaultSceneImmersiveView` does).
* You can also load individual models (like your shoes) that might have been prepared or refined in Reality Composer Pro, and then manipulate them with code (as `GeneralImmersiveView` does).
* You can even load a scene from Reality Composer Pro and then use code to dynamically add to it, remove from it, or modify its entities.

By showcasing both, you'll cover the spectrum from highly programmatic, dynamic AR/VR experiences to visually authored, rich scene compositions. Itâ€™s the perfect way to demonstrate the powerful and flexible toolkit Apple provides for visionOS development.

That sounds like a very insightful and valuable presentation!
